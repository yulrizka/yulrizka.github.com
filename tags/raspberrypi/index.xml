      <description>So I connect one of the GPIO pin to the relay board and from the relay board to the lamp. Now I can control the desk lamp through my raspberry-pi by issuing a linux command. Had been successfully doing this, I wanted to the lamp not only from the raspberry pi but anywhere. The easiest way that I could think of is running a web server inside the raspberry-pi. The debian repository is quite awesome.</description>
