  <p>When working in teams, we are sometimes required to share some password / keys with our team.
The most common way for me is probably through email or some chat client. But even though its convenience it&rsquo;s not
actually a secure and a good practice. Especially if you are providing a service that deal with sensitive information.</p>
<p>Some simple approach would we communicating the password directly with a person through secure medium.
One way to do it is both party ssh through a server and use talk client like <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/write">write</a>.
But for some cases it&rsquo;s quite impractical.</p>
<h2 id="pgp">PGP</h2>
<p>Enter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>. It&rsquo;s basically a software that do a Public-key cryptography.
Public-key cryptography is basically encryption process which require 2 keys, one for encrypting and the other one
for decrypting. Usually the <strong>public key</strong> is used for encrypting and <strong>private key</strong> is use for decrypting.
I would not dive into the details about it since I&rsquo;ve only have basic understanding about it.
But for those people that is interested, you would read the nice article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">wikipedia</a></p>
<p>There is a open source project called GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) and in this article I would like to show you how we could
share some password / key file with it.</p>
<h3 id="instalation">Instalation</h3>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t already have it on your system, you could installed it with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span></code></pre></td>
<td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  $ sudo apt-get install gpg
</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>After installing we would start by creating a pair of keys</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span></code></pre></td>
<td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  $ gpg --gen-key
</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>You will be asked with bunch of questions. Most of the answer you could leave it as a default but most important is fill in your <strong>email</strong>
address and also provide a <strong>Passphrase</strong> to protect your key with password. When it finish gathering information, it will start
creating a key pair by using system entropy. You can help the system to generate the entropy by clicking or moving your mouse randomly
or doing some random IO disk by triggering for example <code>find /</code></p>
<h3 id="listing-keys">Listing keys</h3>
<p>After installing, you can see list of keys by using this command</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">

</div>
</div><p>As you can see that we are successfully decrypted the message. This example you encrypt the message
using your own public key. So this method only work if you want to archive or backup the file securely.
In order to send someone else an encrypted message, you need to encrypt the message using the other
person <strong>public key</strong></p>
<h3 id="distributing-the-key">Distributing the key</h3>
<p>In order for any body to send you a encrypted message, you need to give your <strong>public key</strong>.
Since <strong>public key</strong> only used for encryption, It&rsquo;s OK to publicly share your <strong>public key</strong>.
But never share your <strong>private key</strong>. Once the other party have your <strong>public key</strong> they could
start send you an encrypted message using the command above.</p>
<p>You could share your public key manually to some one (through usb / email etc) by exporting it first just like I mention before.
But there are an easy way to distribute the key. There are some public GPG server that store your public key so that
other people could easily find it and import it into their local machine. There are <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu">http://pgp.mit.edu</a>
and also ubuntu key server <a href="http://keyserver.ubuntu.com">http://keyserver.ubuntu.com</a> that we can use.</p>
<p>To send our key to MIT server we could do</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span><span class="lnt">2

<td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ gpg --send-key --keyserver pgp.mit.edu <span class="m">70280895</span>
gpg: sending key <span class="m">70280895</span> to hkp server pgp.mit.edu
</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>the last number <code>70280895</code> was the key id of the public file. You could find it with the output of <code>gpg --list-keys</code> command.
Now we have successfully send our public key any body could get your public key through that keyserver. You could test this
by searching a name or email or a person in the key server web interface. for example try searching my name on <a href="http://pgp.mit.edu/">http://pgp.mit.edu/</a></p>
<h3 id="importing-keys">Importing Keys</h3>
<p>Now to import other people public key, we could also do that in two way.</p>
<p>if the person give you a file which contain their public key (say <code>ahmy-pub.key</code>). you could import it with</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span></code></pre></td>
<td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ gpg --import ahmy-pub.key
</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>Or if the person already publish his public key to a keyserver, we can search it with</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span><span class="lnt">2
</span><span class="lnt">3
</span><span class="lnt">4
</span><span class="lnt">5

<td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ gpg --search-keys <span class="s1">&#39;Ahmy Yulrizka&#39;</span>

<span class="c1"># or</span>
$ gpg --search-keys <span class="s1">&#39;ahmy135@mail.com&#39;</span>

</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>It will generate a list of keys that found on the keyserver. Enter the number of the keys and it will be imported to your local machine.</p>
<p>after importing you can send an encrypted message to the person for example</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span></code></pre></td>
<td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&#34;This is also a secret&#34;</span> <span class="p">|</span> gpg --encrypt --armor --recipient <span class="s1">&#39;Ahmy Yulrizka&#39;</span> &gt; output.txt.gpg
</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>You could provide a name or an email address as a recipient.
THis command will encrypt the message using public key of a person name <code>Ahmy Yulrizka</code></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>At this point you are able to generate, export, distribute and import keys. More over you can already encrypt
and decrypt file / message to a designated recipient. The the part two of this article I will share some idea
how we could share some password / password key to other member of the team.</p>

<p>So I connect one of the GPIO pin to the relay board and from the relay board to the lamp. Now I can control the desk lamp through
my raspberry-pi by issuing a linux command. Had been successfully doing this, I wanted to the lamp not only from the raspberry pi
but anywhere. The easiest way that I could think of is running a web server inside the raspberry-pi. The debian repository is
quite awesome. So I could install a ruby/python and it only took a single command.</p>
<p>So I did create a <a href="https://github.com/yulrizka/pi-sinatra-gpio/blob/master/app.rb">project</a>  with ruby/sinatra to control this light. Its really small (30 lines of code, 80 lines html + js) and with this project I can control up to 3 light, one of those eventually control the light. In case you are interested, I put the source on <a href="https://github.com/yulrizka/pi-sinatra-gpio/blob/master/app.rb">github</a>.
This project uses <a href="https://github.com/jwhitehorn/pi_piper">pi-piper</a> a ruby library that wrap <a href="https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/">wiringPi</a>, which is library that is used to control the GPIO pin.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now, turning a desk lamp with pi is something; But it&rsquo;s quite boring and not really useful. Now let us make something a bit
interesting. Instead of controlling it manually, The light be trigger on my activity. In this case I the light to turn on
when ever I came back from the office on every working day. So at home my wife know exactly when I leave the office. I already
have it running a web server, so basically I can control it from my mobile phone. But I don&rsquo;t want to do this every single day.
And this is where <a href="http://www.sense-os.nl/commonsense">ComonSense</a> really makes thing easy for me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sense-os.nl/commonsense">CommonSense</a> is a platform to store, retrieve, analyze and interpret our sensory data. What is a sensor ? well anything could be a sensor. From physical sensor on our mobile phone like accelerometer, noise, position, cell network, light, ambience and more sophisticated sensor like sensor that tell your quality of sleep. By using one or more sensor, it could create more intelligent sensor. For example a sensor that tell wether you are standing or sitting by analyzing the accelerometer data. CommonSense is Awesome!, but for this experiment we will be using a simple location sensor. It will tell where is my current location by GPS or
wifi-network.</p>
<p>What is make it easy is I don&rsquo;t have to create an application on my mobile phone. CommonSense already have a platform that run on
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.sense_os.app">Android</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/senseplatform/id447552125?mt=8&amp;uo=4">iOs</a>. The application act as an agent that collect and sample sensor data from the mobile phone. By it self it&rsquo;s not really doing much right now but combine with the <a href="http://www.sense-os.nl/commonsense">CommonSense</a> make it really easy for a developer like me to
easily experiment with my data. So with this sense app, the raspberry-pi could easily get data from my mobile phone through the
<a href="http://developer.sense-os.nl">CommonSense API</a>.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">twitter bootstrap</a>. It&rsquo;s like a css framework to help designer or developer create a nice and clean site.
It&rsquo;s offer grid system, predefine layout, button, javascript, carousel etc. You can build website in just a few hours. Very nice for
prototyping.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it to build this blog since it was version 1. Recently i had a chance to upgrade it to version 2.
The new version offer a lot of functionalities, one the feature that I play a lot is the responsive design.</p>
<p>Basically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_Web_Design">Responsive Web Design</a> (RWD) means the ability of the web site to adapt to the user screen size. So the page should look different
in a way that it suited for specific screen. Like this website will look different if it&rsquo;s open with mobile phone, portrait mode on tablet,
landscape mode on tablet, net book or even in a large desktop. This actually achieved by using W3C CSS3 media query. It means that it uses
different stylesheet for each of the screen size. More info on RWD in twitter bootstrap can be found <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/scaffolding.html#responsive">here</a></p>
<p>You can test this functionality by resizing your browser window. Try to drag it slowly and watch the page banner slightly change.
here are the screen shoot of the design.</p>

  <p>Just a couple days ago I found out <a href="http://www.therubygame.com" title="The Ruby Game">therubygame.com</a> which challenge us to
solve a problem with ruby. The result were measured by the <strong>fastest</strong>, <strong>slowest</strong>, <strong>shortest</strong>, <strong>longest</strong>,
<strong>cheaters</strong> (yup there are also some rule).</p>
<p>And also I was listening to an episode of ruby rouge on <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/034-rr-benchmarking-and-profiling/" title="034 RR Benchmarking and Profiling">Benchmarking</a>. And there is one tools called <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/benchmark_suite" title="benchmark_suite">benchmark_suite</a>.</p>
<p>So there is this <a href="http://www.therubygame.com/challenges/3/submissions" title="Challenge #3">challenge</a> to capitalize first letter of every word. I want to compare my code to the fastest solution there.
so i installed the gem, also the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/ffi" title="ffi gem">ruby-ffi</a> gem that somewhat fix an error while I tried to run the benchmark.</p>

<p>Ambil contoh program Web Server yang diimplementasi menggunakan thread. Fungsi Web Server (WS) adalah menerima request dan
memberikan response kepada web browser. Misalkan WS tersebut hanya memiliki 1 proses, maka apabila ada 10 user yang melakukan
request, maka mereka harus mengantri untuk menerima response dari server. Hal ini bisa diatasi salah satunya dengan menggunakan
thread. Apabila terdapat suatu request, maka proses utama membuat (<em>spawn</em>) suatu thread untuk menangani request tersebut.
Misalkan ada 10 request disaat yang bersamaan, maka terdapat 10 thread yang jalan disaat yang bersamaan. Dalam kasus ini
maka 10 user tersebut akan dilayani pada waktu yang bersamaan.</p>
<p>Ruby 1.8.7 (MRI) memiliki tipe <em>green thread</em>, yaitu thread yang dikelola oleh <em>Virtual Machine</em> sedangkan normalnya thread
dikelola oleh <em>Operating System</em> (OS) atau <em>native thread</em>. Namun implementasi threads untuk tiap interpreter berbeda. Misalkan
pada JRuby dan Rubinius yang menggunakan native threads.</p>
<p>Eksekusi setiap threads dikelola oleh program yang dinamakan <em>scheduler</em>. <em>preemptive scheduling</em> adalah suatu metode
yang digunakan <em>scheduler</em> dengan memanfaatkan <em>interrupt</em>. Artinya scheduler mengirimkan <em>interrupt</em> kepada suatu thread
untuk berhenti dan menjalankan thread lain. secara default MRI menggunakan <em>fair scheduler</em>. Artinya masing-masing thread
akan dijadwalkan (dijalankan) dengan waktu yang sama.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Terdapat 2 thread: Thread pertama melakukan io-blocking selama 40ms dan komputasi 10ms. sedangkan
thread kedua melakukan 50ms komputasi.</p>
<p>Berikut adalah implementasi dalam thread dan juga fiber:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Pada contoh pertama, thread 2 memakan waktu 100ms, sedangkan pada contoh yang kedua hanya memakan waktu 60ms.</p>
<p>Dengan menggunakan fiber, program berjalan sekan-akan sychronous (blocking). Oleh karena itu fiber
merupakan kandidat yang cocok untuk diterapkan pada pemograman <em>Event-Driven</em> atau <em>Asynchronous programming</em> seperti
pada <em>EventMachine</em> di ruby</p>

      Scale MongoDB dengan Sharding

<h2 id="introduksi-">Introduksi</h2>
<p>MongoDB adalah salah satu NoSQL database yang cukup populer. MongoDB merupakan document store database, dimana data disimpan dalam format
BSON atau mirip dengan JSON. Keunggulan mongoDB antara lain adalah automatic sharding. Artinya apabila kita memiliki beberapa server database,
kita dapat melakukan partisi terhadap data tersebut dan mongo akan melakukan load balancing terhadap data tersebut secara automatis</p>
<p>Sebelum mengeksplorasi mongodb, ada beberapa konsep yang harus kita pahami tentang mongo. yaitu:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mongod</li>
<li>Replicas</li>
<li>Shards</li>
<li>Shard Keys</li>
<li>Chunks</li>
<li>Config DB Process (config server)</li>
<li>Routing Process (mongos)</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="mongod-">mongod</h3>
<p>mongod adalah core dari mongoDB. mongod adalah satu instance server mongo. Saya sendiri tidak tau kepanjangan dari mongod tapi kalau menebak,
mungkin yang dimaksud adalah mongo daemon. Kalau di analogikan, 1 mongod adalah 1 server database (misalkan sama dengan 1 server mysql). Sehingga
satu aplikasi sedehana cukup dibuat dengan 1 application server yang berkomunikasi dengan 1 mongod</p>
<h3 id="replica-">Replica</h3>
<p>Replica set adalah suatu bentuk Master/slave database. 1 replika terdiri dari 2 atau lebih proses mongod yang memiliki data yang sama.
Replica bertujuan untuk <em>failover</em>, <em>reducancy</em> juga sebagai <em>distribution read load</em>
. Artinya apabila terdapat beberapa request read terhadap data yang sama, maka request tersebut bisa di handle oleh lebih dari satu server</p>
<p>Contoh, misalkan kita mempunyai 3 data center: Jakarta, Bandung dan Surabaya. maka kita dapat membentuk replika sebagai berikut.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Contoh horizontal partitioning misalkan kita memiliki data center seperti diatas. Maka kita dapat menyimpan semua data user jakarta ke data
center jakarta, bandung ke bandung dan lainya ke surabaya. Apabila terdapat request terhadap data bandung maka cukup server bandung yang melayani
data tersebut.</p>
<p>Shard dalam mongoDB teridiri dari beberapa server (mongod). Beberapa server tersebut dalam shard membentuk replika set. sehingga dapat kita katakan
suatu replika set berada pada suatu sharding.</p>
<h3 id="shard-key-">shard key</h3>
<p>Untuk membagi-bagi suatu data, maka dibutuhkan suatu <em>key</em> yang menentukan data tersebut akan masuk ke shard yang mana. Key tersebut disebut dengan
<strong>shard key</strong>. untuk contoh diatas <em>shard key</em> adalah lokasi. Pada contoh lain kita dapat membuat email sebagai <em>shard key</em>. sehingga data suatu
user akan dikelompokkan pada suatu shard yang sama.</p>
<p>Pemilihan <em>shard key</em> sangat bergantung dengan bagaimana cara aplikasi berintarksi untuk mengakses data. Sehingga pemilihan <em>shard key</em> dapat
mempengaruhi performa dari sistem. Pemilihan <em>shard key</em> yang salah dapat menyebabkan database beroperasi lebih lambat dari <em>single instance</em>
database.</p>
<p>Untuk kriteria pemilihan <em>shard key</em> dapat dilihat pada artikel <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Choosing+a+Shard+Key"><em>Choosing a shard key</em></a></p>
<h3 id="chunks-">Chunks</h3>
<p><em>Chunk</em> adalah <em>continuous range of data for a particular collection</em>. Misalkan kita melakukan partisi data berdasarkan ID. dan ID tersebut
merupakan bilangan integer antara 1..1000. Kita dapat membagi data tersebut dalam beberapa bagian (chunk) dengan ukuran yang sama. Secara
default ukuran 1 <em>chunk</em> dalam mongoDB adalah 64MB (meskipun bisa dikonfigurasi). Untuk contoh kasus data tersebut bisa dibagi menjadi 10 chunk.
dengan:</p>
<ul>
<li>chunk-1: 1..100</li>
<li>chunk-2: 101..200</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
<li>chunk-10: 901..1000</li>
</ul>
<p>Suatu Chunk disimpan pada suatu shard tertentu. Keistimewaan mongoDB salah satunya adalah auto sharding. Artinya suatu chunk dapat di transfer
dari suatu shard ke shard yang lain.</p>
<p>Misalkan contoh diatas, 3 shard. Pada shard pertama terdapat 10 chunk. MongoDB akan melakukan balancing dengan melakukan transfer ke 2 shard
yang lain sampai ukuran chunk pada tiap shard menjadi seimbang. Hal ini dilakukan secara automatis, meskipun kita juga dapat melakukannya secara
manual.</p>
<h3 id="config-db-process-config-server-">Config DB Process (Config server)</h3>
<p>Selain mongod, dalam proses sharding dibutuhkan suatu prosess (program) yang bertugas untuk menyimpan informasi mengenai shard-server dan chunk
didalam shard tersebut. informasi tersebut dikenal dengan meta-data. Kita dapat menjalankan 1 atau 3 <em>Config Server</em>. Tentu pada production
dibutuhkan 3 config server. Ketika satu mati maka masih tersisa 2 cadangan <em>Config server</em>.</p>
<p>Tidak seperti mongod, <em>Config Server</em> tidak berkomunikasi antara satu dengan yang lain. Ketika satu proses mati, biasanya dihidupkan dengan
melakukan restore terhadap dump dari server yang lain. Ketika server ini mati.</p>
<h3 id="routing-process-mongos-">Routing Process (mongos)</h3>
<p>Selain mongod dan <em>config server</em>, element lain yang penting adalah <strong>mongos</strong>. Fungsi utama dari mongos adalah melakukan routing terhadap
request ke shard yang memiliki data tersebut. Pada saat aplikasi ini dijalankan. ia akan mengambil data dari <em>config server</em>. Aplikasi yang
kita miliki berkomunikasi layaknya dengan server database biasa. Misalkan sebelumnya aplikasi kita setup ke url mongod, sekarang setelah
kita melakukan konfigurasi pada sharding, kita cukup mengarahkan url ke proses mongos.</p>
<p>Proses mongos ini relativ lebih kecil. Kadang kita dapat menjalankan mongos pada server aplikasi kita. Ada juga yang menjalankan proses mongos
di mesin yang sama dengan mongod.</p>
<h2 id="implementasi-">Implementasi</h2>
<p>Ok, setelah kita mengerti beberapa konsep mengenai sharding, mari kita membuat suatu contoh kasus bagaimana melakukan implementasi terhadap
sharding berikut. Untuk kemudahan, maka semua <em>instance</em> server ktia letakkan pada server yang sama (localhost). Hal ini berlaku untuk
mongod, Config Server, mongos dan server aplikasi.</p>
<p>Pada contoh kasus ini kita akan menjalankan beberpa server sebagai berikut</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Monogod. port 10000 &amp; 10001</li>
<li>1 Config Server. port 20000</li>
<li>1 Mongos</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mongod--1">Mongod</h3>
<p>Dalam kasus ini, saya berasumsi anda telah melakukan instalasi terhadap mongo server. Untuk menjalankan 2 proses mongod, jalankan perintah berikut</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">

</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><h3 id="configuration-server--mongos-">Configuration Server &amp; Mongos</h3>
<p>Berikutnya yang kita lakukan adalah menjalankan Configuration server dan Mongos dengan perintah berikut</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span><span class="lnt">2

<td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">  $ mkdir config

  $ mongod --configsvr --dbpath <span class="nv">$PWD</span>/config --port <span class="m">20000</span> &gt; /tmp/configdb.log <span class="p">&amp;</span>
  $ cat /tmp/configdb.log <span class="c1"># pastikan server berjalan</span>
  <span class="c1"># start mongos</span>
  $ mongos --configdb localhost:20000 --chunkSize <span class="m">1</span> &gt; /tmp/mongos.log <span class="p">&amp;</span>
  $ cat /tmp/mongos.log <span class="c1"># pastikan server tersebut berjalan</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>pada contoh diatas, mongos tidak membutuhkan <code>--dbpath</code>, karena mongo tidak memerlukan <em>persistance</em> (penyimpanan data). Perintah <code>mongos</code> diatas
akan menjalankan mongos pada port default (sama serperti port default mongod) yaitu 27017</p>
<p><code>--chinkSize 1</code> merupakan opsi untuk menentukan ukuran chunk 1MB (defaultnya 64MB). Hal ini bertujuan untuk explorasi saja. sehingga kita tidak
perlu memassukkan data berukuran 64MB untuk membuat satu chuck baru.</p>
<h2 id="setup-cluster-">Setup Cluster</h2>
<p>Sampai tahap ini yang telah kita lakukan adalah mejalankan 2 <em>process</em> mongod, 1 <em>process config server</em> dan 1 <em>process</em> mongos. Berikutnya
yang kita lakukan adalah melakukan setup agar server tersebut dapat saling berkomunikasi.</p>
<h3 id="konfigurasi-shard-server-pada-mongos-">Konfigurasi Shard Server pada mongos</h3>
<p>Berikutnya yang kita lakukan adalah setup mongos agar menambahkan 2 shard server yang berjalan pada port 10000 &amp; 10001.</p>

<ul>
<li>test.people-email_MinKey berada pada shard0001</li>

<p>MongoDB ternyata melakukan partisi terhadap <em>shard key</em> dengan memperlakukan key tersebut sebagai string.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Buat rekan-rekan yang sedang belajar atau bekerja di Belanda, terkadang kita rindu sanak saudra.
Sebenarnya banyak cara untuk dapat berbincang dengan keluarga di Indonesia dengan mudah</p>
<p>Servis gratis misalkan:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/">Google Hangouts</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/android/28000016">Whatsapp calling</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Namun kadang-kadang berkomunikasi dengan aplikasi diatas kadang sulit. hal ini bisa dikarenakan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tidak ada koneksi internet, atau koneksi yang kurang baik. Sehingga telepon kadang terputus, atau yang ditelepon mejadi suka berbahasa robot</li>
<li>Tidak ada perangkat komputer atau telepon selurer yang dapat <em>diinstall</em> aplikasi diatas</li>
<li>Orang yang dituju kadang sedang berada di luar (rumah / kantor) sehingga tidak memiliki akses wifi/internet atau komputer</li>
</ul>
<p>Terdapat beberapa alternatif untuk kita dapat menelefon dengan murah ke nomor telepon di Indonesia.</p>
<p>Contohnya provider selular <a href="http://www.lebara.nl/prepaid/rates">Lebara</a> saat ini tarifnya
<strong>19ct/menit</strong> untuk landline dan <strong>29ct/menit</strong> untuk mobile. Tapi karena untuk lebara beli 10 dapat 20 euro
maka praktis harganya menjadi setengahnya. Saya sendiri belum pernah melefon pakai lebara
sehingga saya tidak bisa mengatakan mengenai kualitas dan delay bila menelpon pakai lebara.</p>
<p>Nah ada cara lain untuk lebih berhemat sampai <strong>3ct/menit</strong> !!
Syaratnya teman-teman hanya butuh akses internet dan device yang mendukung VoIP (komputer, smart phone).
Selain Menelepon kita juga dapat mengirimkan pesan singkat melalui SMS ke nomor Indonesia.
Namun ada kekuranganna juga, kadang terdapat delay sekitar 1-2 detik tergantung dari kualitas jaringan VoIP tersebut.</p>
<h2 id="bagaimana-caranya-">Bagaimana caranya ?</h2>
<p>Tergantung perangkat yang teman-teman miliki disini.</p>
<p><strong>PENTING</strong>. Pada saat register nanti pastikan provider VoIP yang kita pilih mendukung SIP.</p>
<p>Kita cukup register ke salah satu provider VoIP dan install aplikasi.</p>
<p>Setelah register account ke salah satu VoIP provider, anda akan menerima informasi contohnya;</p>
<pre><code>sip gateway: sip.webcalldirect.com
username: foo
password: secret
</code></pre><p>Informasi ini yang dibutuhkan aplikasi untuk dapat terkoneksi dengan provider tersebut.</p>
<h3 id="android">Android</h3>
<p>Saya pakai aplikasi <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zoiper.android.app&amp;hl=en">zoiper</a>.
Instalasinya juga cukup mudah.
Anda tinggal memasukkan data account ke aplikasi zoiper dan bisa tinggal langsung menelepon ke indonesia dengan VOIP.</p>
<p><strong>PENTING</strong> pastikan ketika menelepon anda menggunakan aplikasi tersebut, bukan applikasi telepon android.
Bila tidak maka anda akan menggunakan pulsa telepon biasa.</p>
<h3 id="mac">Mac</h3>
<p>Terdapat aplikasi <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/telephone/id406825478?mt=12">Telephone</a> yang penggunaanya juga mudah.
Serupa dengan android, kita hanya perlu memasukkan informasi yang di dapat dari provider ke aplikasi tersebut.</p>
<h3 id="platform-lainnya">Platform lainnya</h3>
<p>Windows, linux, iOS (iPhone).</p>
<p>Berhubung saya jarang menelepon dengan device yang menggunakan sistem operasi diatas jadi saya kurang faham juga :)</p>
<p>Di website providernya kadang terdapat bagian &lsquo;Download&rsquo; dimana anda bisa langsung mengguakan aplikasi dari mereka:
contohnya <a href="http://www.dialcheap.com/download/desktop">seperti ini</a></p>
<p>Tapi caranya pasti sama mudahnya. Kita tinggal <em>googling</em> dengan keywords &ldquo;[windows/linux/iPhone] SIP client&rdquo; anda pasti menemukan
banyak aplikasi dan tutorial yang cukup mudah.</p>
<h2 id="registrasi-account-voip--pembelian-credit">Registrasi Account VoIP &amp; Pembelian Credit.</h2>
<p>Saat ini banyak sekali provider VoIP yang tersedia di Internet. Untuk pembelian credit mereka juga sudah mendukung berbagai metode pembayaran:</p>
<ul>
<li>iDeal</li>
<li>paypal</li>
<li>kartu kredit</li>
<li>DSB</li>
</ul>
<p>Nah, barusan saya membuat <em>script</em> sederhana untuk melakukan <em>scraping</em>  provider mana yang paling murah.</p>
<p><em>script</em> ?? <em>scraping</em> ?? :) no worries, yang penting adalah berikut hasil excel sheet provider dan tarif mereka per <strong>5 mei 2015</strong></p>
<p><a href="/files/voip-list-03052015.xlsx">voip-list-03052015.xlsx</a></p>
<p>Dari file ditatas kita bisa melihat tarif land-line, tarif selular berdasarkan provider dan negara yang dituju. Pastikan melihat kolom <strong>rate + vat</strong>.</p>
<p>Saat ini provider yang paling murah telepon ke Indonesia adalah:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dialcheap.com/rates/calling-rates">dialcheap.com</a> mobile: 2.9ct/menit, landline: 1.1ct/menit</li>
<li><a href="http://www.freevoipdeal.com/calling_rates/">freevoipdial.com</a> mobile: 3ct/menit,  landline: 2.5ct/menit</li>
<li><a href="http://www.voipsmash.com/rates/calling-rates">voipmash.com</a> mobile: 3.1ct/menit, landline: 1.1ct/menit</li>
<li><a href="http://www.discountcalling.com/rates/calling-rates">discountcalling.com</a> mobile: 4ct/menit, landline: 1.1ct/menit</li>
</ul>
<p>Setelah Register dan mendownload aplikasi dari mereka, anda tinggal memasukan data gateway, username password dan lansung menelepon nomor indonesia</p>
<p>Selamat menikmati :)</p>
