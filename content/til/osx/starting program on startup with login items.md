I need to start [jumpcut](https://github.com/yulrizka/til/blob/master/osx/manage%20clipboard%20easily%20with%20jumpcut.md)
during startup because I have to start it manually now.

We can add one or more program to start when we are logged in.
Use system preference > Users & Groups. Select your username and there should be *Login items* tabs
where you can add more or disable programs.
