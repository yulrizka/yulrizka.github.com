      <title>Testing go 1.5 cross compilation on raspberry pi</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m so excited with the new release of golang. One particular feature is now very easy to build for multiple architecture. If you seen my other posts, I also like to tinker with my raspberry-pi. On my previous project I use either ruby or python for building some stuff. One annoying thing is dependency, setup and compilation is usually quite slow. Would be cool if I could just create some stuff in desktop and just scp the binary to pi and everything should work!</description>

      <description>Push To Talk app for OSX
PushToTalk App installer   As a part of scrum teams, every day I need to give updates to my team via Google Hangout. We have a team here in the Netherlands and also in Indonesia. Some times I am in the same room as a colleague of mine. This sometimes quite annoying because I can hear my self (with a delay) from his mic.</description>

      <description>Disect the rocket, image by ProudloveNathan Proudlove  I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with a iOS project this past week. I&amp;rsquo;m adding functionalities to the CommonSense iOS library. One of the most annoying thing is that it took about 2 minute to load the project. This is only happened in the unstable branch. The master branch seems to be working fine. So I knew that somewhere there is a commit when this starts happening.</description>

      <description>Some time it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to test functionality that involves with system time. Especially when we wanted to test specific functionality. For example testing whether today is end of month. It&amp;rsquo;s unrealistic to run this test case once every month.
I can think of multiple ways to address this issue. It depends on the use case where it may apply to the use-cases
Passing the time object 1 2 3  func CheckEndOfMonth(now time.</description>

      <description>You are probably familiar with above images. Some random friend sent you an email which you can instantly recognize as a spam because it only contains one link. Couple days ago I receive this email which is not the first time for me. But this time it was different. It actually came from my own Yahoo! account which I never use since more that one year ago.
My first instinct is to check whether the mail really got sent from my account or it just spoofing my email address.</description>

      <description>Berksfhel is cookbook dependency for chef. If you are familiar with ruby / python, think of it as a Bundler or virtual environment for chef
I faced this core dump error while doing berks upload. That command will actualy push some cookbook to a chef server.

      <description>When working in teams, we are sometimes required to share some password / keys with our team. The most common way for me is probably through email or some chat client. But even though its convenience it&amp;rsquo;s not actually a secure and a good practice. Especially if you are providing a service that deal with sensitive information.
Some simple approach would we communicating the password directly with a person through secure medium.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been tinkering with my raspberry-pi for quite some time now. What I like about it because it is cheap ($25), it&amp;rsquo;s run Linux (especially debian based) and most of all it&amp;rsquo;s have General Purpose Input Output pin. Since I was a kid, I always wanted to control electronic appliance remotely. Luckily my friend @pimnijdam thought me how to control a relay board. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s just like an electric switch that connect/disconnect current when you supply a low voltage.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with twitter bootstrap. It&amp;rsquo;s like a css framework to help designer or developer create a nice and clean site. It&amp;rsquo;s offer grid system, predefine layout, button, javascript, carousel etc. You can build website in just a few hours. Very nice for prototyping.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it to build this blog since it was version 1. Recently i had a chance to upgrade it to version 2. The new version offer a lot of functionalities, one the feature that I play a lot is the responsive design.</description>

      <description>If you having a problem in jekyll when it didn&amp;rsquo;t generate a post and there is no error in the log file. you might want to check the content if there is any UTF-8 character encoding such as this Â±
The problem arise if you use ruby 1.9. It rejecting a file that contain non-ASCII character. it actually got invalid multibyte char (US-ASCII) error message

      <description>Just a couple days ago I found out therubygame.com which challenge us to solve a problem with ruby. The result were measured by the fastest, slowest, shortest, longest, cheaters (yup there are also some rule).
And also I was listening to an episode of ruby rouge on Benchmarking. And there is one tools called benchmark_suite.
So there is this challenge to capitalize first letter of every word. I want to compare my code to the fastest solution there.</description>
